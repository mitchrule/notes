# Introduction to the Principles of Computer Security

We care about

- The software on machines
- The communication links
- How the humans interact with them
- How they can be misused

Computer Security

- Fundamental goals - often translate into security services
- Design is critical, or else you're eternally mopping up
- Training the humans, often the weakest link
- Usability is key: HCI for security matters

## Fundamental Goals of Computer Security

To protect:

1. protect data, computer hardware and software plus related communications networks, and
   physical world devices and elements they control, from intentional misuse by unauthorised parties, or their authorised agents.
2. protecting computers against unintentional damage or mistakes, or that fall under the categories of reliability and redundancy also important.

### Common Sub-Areas in Enterprises

_May want to use these when researching for group project_

- Advanced Threat Protection
- Data Centre Protection
- Data Loss Prevention
- Endpoint Protection
- Enterprose Security Architecture
- Governance, Compliance and Privacy
- Identity and Access Management
- Monitoring
- Remote Access
- Risk Management and Business Processes
- Security Analytics and Intelligence

### High Level Security Goals

There are six high level security goals, sometimes referred to as C.I.A.(A.A.A.)

- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Authorisation
- Availability
- Authentication
- Accountability

### Risk Assessments

Questions:

1. What assets are the most valuable, and what are their values?
2. What system vulnerabilities exist?
3. What are the relevant threat agents and attack vectors?
4. What are the associated estimates of attack probabilities, or frequencies?

Answering this quantitatively can be a challenge, due to unknowns:

- Incomplete knowledge of culnerabilities, worsened by rapid technology evolution.
- The difficulty of quantifying the value of intangible assets/
- Incomplete knowledge of threat agents.

### Why Computer Security is Hard

1. Intelligent, adaptive adversary
2. No rulebook
3. Defender-attacker asymmetry
4. Scale of attack
5. Universal connectivity
6. Pace of technology evolution
7. Software complexity
8. Developer training and tools
9. Interoperability and backwards compatibility
10. Market economics and stakeholders
11. Features beat security
12. Low cost beats quality
13. Missing contect of danger and losses
14. Managing secrets is difficult
15. User non-compliance (human factors)
16. Error-inducing design (human factors)
17. Non-expert users (human factors)
18. Security not designed in
19. Introducing new exposures
20. Government obstacles
