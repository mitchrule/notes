# Privacy

## Concepts of Privacy

- Anonymity and privacy are two different but related concepts
  - Is anonymity a type of privacy?
  - Do you need security for privacy?
- Privacy and security are two different things
- You're leaving digital footprints everywhere
- Encryption security technologies are good for privacy

  - Don't assume anonymity comes with them
  - Traffic analysis is very revealing
  - Endpoints are a major point of weakness in security and privacy

- 30% of customers prioritise convenience over security
  - Login without password (automatic device recognition) very attractive
  - Reject notion of one time password sent to them on each login
- How to get high adoption of privacy enhancing features
  - Good UI is incredibly important
  - Good error reporting

## Notifiable Data Breach Scheme

- Noify individuals whose personal information is onvolved in a data breach that is likely to result in serious harm to an individual whose personal data is involved
- Recommend the steps individuals should take in response to the breach
- A data breach occurs when personal information an organisation or agency holds is lost or subjected to unauthorised access
  - A device containing personal information is lost or stolen
  - A database is hacked
  - Information is accidentally given to the wrong person

## Privacy for the Consumer

- Old surveillance
  - What you say
  - Transaction based
  - Conversations
  - Postal mail
  - Wire taps on phones
  - Chat logs
- New surveillance
  - Who you are
  - Movement tracking of consumers in private-public spaces
  - Facial recognition
  - Mood analysis
- New new surveillance
  - Who we say you are

### Models of Consent in Data Gathering

- Forced consent
  - A clickwrap 'take it or leave it' approach
- Unforced consent
  - Fully informed, and where consumers have some control over their own data
- No consent
  - No information or opportunity to opt out is provided to users of a space or service

### Where is the Harm?

- Economic harm
  - Lack of competition
  - Large players have more data and therefore a huge advantage over new entrants in markets
- Differential pricing
  - Consumers may not be aware of it, and the reasons
- Denial of opportunity or service
  - Reduced offerings. What jobs are shown to women? Different ethnicities?
- Chilling effect
  - Reduction in fundamental rights such as freedom of expression. Self-censorship of what is said online, or on social media

### Lesson 1: Privacy

- Give consumers genuine opt-out choices
- Consumers need to be aware of differential pricing, and the reasons
- Protect against denial of opportunity/service
- Chilling effect
  - Staff and customers need protections for speaking freely in their private lives
- Strongly recommended
  - Community consumer advisory council, including a data ethicist, to calibrate with the community

### Lesson 2: Transparency

Be as transparent as reasonably possible

- Use it as a tool of trust
- The more powerful you are, the more transparency is going to matter as an ethical signal

### Lesson 3: Cybersecurity

- Wrap the cybersecurity around the human processes, or else humans develop workarounds
- Allow resources, such as paid staff time, to implement
- Take staff on the journey with you, so they own it
- Engage in local community outreach, good for Australia and for your staff
