# Human Factors in Cybersecurity

How many of the big problems in day to day cybersecurity can be attributed to humans?

The Big Five: Insecurity of endpoint, online account, password, data at rest, and data in transit.

- Did the human forget to patch the device? (Yes)
- Did the human choose a bad password? (Yes)
- Did the human reuse that passoword ? (Yes)
- Did the human forget to enable 2FA? (Yes)

Phishing

- Tricks the user into visiting a fraudulent version of a legitimate website.

Spear Phishing

- Targets specific individuals (posing as known contact, compromising their mailbox)

Whaling

- Spear phishing but aimed at large, high profile targets (senior executives, government ministers). They usually have higher support and training from their IT team, so attacks are more sophisticated, highly tailored.
- Spearfishing tactics don't always work. e.g. you cannot pose as someone's boss
- Threats to reputation or fear of legal action for example may evoke the reaction the attackers is looking for.
- In one reported case, a collection of executives were whaled by a fake subpoena to appear before a grand jury in a US count in a civil matter.
- They all depend on weaknesses in human factors.

Automated security systems are beginning to become more common and are reducing the cost and frequency of breaches. Despite this, the human role in cybersecurity is still important and will be around for many years to come. This is particularly true when it comes to cybersecurity strategy.

## Spearfishing at ANU

A senior staff member received a phishing email containing a document that they previewed, allowing the attack to take place. When the attached document was previewed, the staff member's credentials were sent to many external addresses.

## Research Study #1

- 50,000 individuals within an organisation.
- All emails were addressed to the recipient.
- Contained a corresponding logo related to the fictitious organisation.
- Also contained a link within the text that recipients were encouraged to click in order to respond to the email content.
  - This link redirected to an internal website notifying them they had fallen for a phishing attack
- The mean click rate was 19.44%
- Both authority and urgency were associated with an increased click rate.

## Research Study #2

Aim:

- Do factors external to the phishing message itself, such as aspects related to the recipient or the context in which they are operating, impart susceptibility to spear phishing.

Focus groups were used to understand which factors influence employees responses to phishing attacks.

1. Familiar with message sender
2. Whether they were expecting the communication
3. The presence of authentic information
4. Lack of awareness of the influence techniques commonly contained within soear phishing emails.
5. Operating within a pressued cognitive context.

Results:

Staff who regularly received external emails found it more difficult to determine the authenticity of the mail. But staff who regularly encountered fraudulent emails knew far better who to report them to in the organisation.

Centralised inboxes were identified as an issue. Many people sharing an inbox made it more difficult to determine which emails were dangerous, due to the nature of many external emails being received.

Staff wanted feedback on whether anything was done about the phishing mail. Otherwise it felt worthless to report malicious emails. This process had to be frictionless and easy to get people on board.

The role of peer support in verifying emails was very important. This is especially important now that many people are working from home and we don't have "water cooler chat".

The most successful organisations have a no blame culture. People are much more likely to self report and educate themselves. Are staff going to be paid for the hours they spend reporting? Is it easy to do?
