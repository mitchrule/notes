# What is a project?

Temporary endeavour to create a unique product, service, or result.

## Waterfall Model

Dates back to the 1970's

Stages of software development were done sequentially. Requirements -> Design -> Execution -> Testing -> Release.

## Agile

### Manisfesto for Agile Software Development

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

### Agile Methods

- Scrum
- Extreme Programming
- Kanban
- Scrub-ban

#### Scrum Methodology

- Sprints last for 1-4 weeks
- Team selects how much to do by sprints end
- Team leader - often scrum master
- During a sprint, you do not change the scope
- Throughout the sprint you have standups, often daily
- Review at the end of each sprint

### Agile in COMP30022

- Appreciate that most of us have little background.
- Standups weekly.
- Sprints: $ 3 \times 3 $ weeks
- Dynamically consider scope each sprint.
- Flexible.
- Lightweight.
- Retrospectives (end of each sprint).
  - Internal review of progress.

### Communication Skills

- Essential.
- Need to know what teammates are working on.
- Think about meeting dynamics.
- Be open to 'tone' of emails and conversations.
- Practice reading and writing.

Reflections on guest lectures. 500 words on what you learned/what you found interesting from the lecture - not a summary of the lecture.

## Requirements

- Change from previous CIS subjects.
- Some exposure to what IT projects are like in practice.
- No fixed process due to carying backgrounds of students, different team capabilities, etc.
- Practice learning things - user stories, motivational modelling.
- Supervisors are observing team engagement, cooperative processes and sensible behaviour.

### Issues with Requirements

- How to document client requests.
- Privacy of artifacts.
  - Confidentiality agreements.
- Intellectual Property agreements.
- Take care when formulating questions.
- Appreciate this is new territory for most.
- Do/be/feel process strongly recommended and discussed in week 4 lecture.
