# Decidable Problems

Problems regarding regular languages tend to be decidable.

We can phrase these problems as _language_ decidability problems.
For example, the acceptance problem for DFAs is whether, given a DFA $D$, and a string $w$, $D$ accepts input $w$. We can represent $D$ and $w$ and feed this into a Turing machine which simulates $D$.
