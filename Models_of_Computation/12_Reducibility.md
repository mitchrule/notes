# Reducibility

Semi-decidable is equivalent to recognisable.

## Closure Properties

The set of Turing recognisable languages is closed under the regular operations, and intersection. It is not closed under complement.

_Theorem_: A language $L$ is decidable iff both $L$ and its complement $L^C$ are Turing recognisable.
